# @plasius/gpu-model-obj

OBJ and MTL import, export, triangulation policy, and explicit fidelity-loss reports.

This repository is the dedicated package boundary defined by ADR 0094.

## Bootstrap status

This initial repository contains the approved schema baseline, legal and governance files, and a package smoke-test surface. Functional model conversion work is tracked in the repository's [TASK] issues and must flow through the canonical GPU model boundary.

## Rollout

- Feature flag: gpu.model.conversion.enabled
- Capability: none for this package-only layer
- Rollback: disable the feature flag and keep the published package version pinned to the last validated release

## Development

Requires Node.js 24 and npm.

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Release integrity

CI keeps the administrative contributor registry outside Git and npm package
artifacts using exact, case-normalised path checks. CI runs on approved
self-hosted runners. Release preparation and npm publication use GitHub-hosted
runners with Node.js 24.18.0 LTS. CD remains disabled until the npm trusted
publisher binding is verified and the legacy token fallback is removed.
